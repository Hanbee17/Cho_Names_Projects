ART101 Final Projects

Title: Names

Format: Interactive website

User Interaction : For this project, users would experience disturbing moods of seeing lists of names that died and hearing the recordings of the incidents.

## Purpose

This project began from my ongoing question about why should people move on from loss. For this project, I will continue to make an interactive website based on mass death caused by incidents. For my final project , I created a webpage based on the Sewol Ferry Tragedy. I used the lists of names of the people who died and made some users interact with it. For visualization, I used a ferry ship and a side view of the ocean.
