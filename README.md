ART101 Final Projects

Title: Names

Format: Interactive website

Concept: The user will experience an interactive website.

**Project Overview**

This project began from my ongoing question about why should people move on from loss. For this project,  I will create an interactive website based on mass death caused by incidents. For example, for my final, I will create a webpage based on Sewol Ferry Tragedy. I will get the lists of names of the people who died and make users interact with it. For visualization, I will use a ferry ship and a side view of the ocean. When users are scrolling the page, the ship will gradually sink into the ocean and the names will be appearing with various noises (I will use live news and videos filmed during the incident). In the end, users will be able to read descriptions of what happened. This is supposed to be a terrible and traumatic experience that makes the user think and know what happened and why it should be remembered. Moreover, I will make this webpage in three languages, Korean, English, and Spanish.
